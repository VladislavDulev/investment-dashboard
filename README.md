# Investment Tracking Application

## Overview

This is a React-based application designed to help users track their investments. The application consists of two main pages: Investments and Settings. Users can navigate between these pages using a responsive side navigation menu. The Investments page provides an overview of the user's investments, including a dashboard with data visualization and a card-based table panel for new investments and investment management. The Settings page allows users to edit their personal details. The app provides a dark mode functionality.

## Investments Page

The Investments Page has three widgets at the top with an overview of the total amount of investments made as well as the open vs closed amount. The chart underneath provides the user with the proportion of their investments by stock in percenteges. The Invested Management section, situated underneath is a detailed breakdown of each investment by card. It is where the user can add new investments or open/close existing ones. All changes in the Invested Management section are recalculated in the widgets on the top of the page immediately.
